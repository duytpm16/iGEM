# iGEM

An R Shiny application to summarize and visualize gene-environment interaction (GEI) results from the [GEM](https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/GEM), [REGEM](https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/REGEM), and [METAGEM](https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/METAGEM) software programs.

## 2. Usage

1. **Run iGEM locally**

It is recommended to run iGEM locally for large file sizes (> 500 MB). 

```
shiny::runApp("iGEM")
```

<br />

2. **Using the web**

Alternatively, iGEM can be accessed at [shinyapps.io](https://duytpm18.shinyapps.io/igem/).
> **Note** 
> 
> iGEM is deployed for free at [shinyapps.io](https://duytpm18.shinyapps.io/igem/). It allows up to 1 GB of memory usage. Therefore, a large file will not be uploaded and/or summarized successfully. In this case, please run iGEM locally.
